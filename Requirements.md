#TASK
Create a webpage that has:
A H1 tag
A H2 tag
A Header that contains a list of navigation items, styled to be horizontal across the top of the screen
A section which contains three paragraphs, each paragraph should correspond to an item on your header
Create the following events on your webpage (You can choose if it use Jquery or not!)
If a user clicks on the h1 tag,  the background should change colour, if they move their mouse out of the space the background should return to the original colour.
If a user hovers over a h2 tag replace the words inside it to contain a greeting
If someone types a letter whilst viewing the webpage a new paragraph should be created and that letter should be added to it.
If someone clicks on one of the navigation items the styling of the connecting paragraph should change to be more bold and be a larger font size. If they click again on the same navigation item, the paragraph should revert to original styling.
